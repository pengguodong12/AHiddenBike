# AHiddenBike
THe project belongs to our program in the curriculumn Software Engineering. We team try to make an Android application which help students in Tsinghua University find their bicycles easily using bluetooth in smartphones and a MCU system installed on bicycles.

To be specific, we plan to make use of the relationship between Received Signal Strength Indication(RSSI) and distance to help users to locate their bicycles. And users can send some intructions to the MCU on their bicycles via bluetooth of smartphones making LEDs on bicycles glimmer or bells ring, so that users can find their bicycles quickly. And actually our final product can be used to look for not only a bike but also other daily items, such as keys and wallets.

Our project covers two parts - Android programming and MCU system establishment which also involves a heavy programming task.
